# library-app

Library app is a library management tool created in a Udemy course I took to improve my Java skills with more recent frameworks and methodologies, specially regarding Java EE 7 and some nice additions to Java 8.

The course covered several technologies, and also best practices, such as writing automated tests (both unit and integration) for most of the code, refactoring, OOP (object-oriented programming) and much more.
